    "# Exercise: Finish a program to fill a 2D array\n",
    "\n",
    "The program [image_creator.cpp](image_creator.cpp) draws on many of the C++ concepts that are taught in this lesson. It also introduces the way in which accelerated frameworks like OpenCL and HIP execute small functions called *kernels* over iteration spaces of up to three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within **main**, the program allocates an array `arr` of size (4x6). This array is one-dimensional, but it is accessed as if it was *folded* into a 2D array of size (N0=4, N1=6). The program used nested loops to iterate over the domain of `arr` and each coordinate (i0, i1) it executes a function called `fill_kernel` to fill the array with the value of i0xi1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is fairly straightforward and requires **only two lines of code**. However these two lines require a *firm grasp* of multi-dimensional array indexing in order to get it right. Within the function `fill_kernel` you need to use **row-major** ordering to fill `arr` at coordinates `(i0, i1)` with the value of `i0*i1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supplied function `m_show_matrix` prints out the array to the command line and the program writes the resulting image to a file called `image.dat`. You are welcome to use these tools to help debug your code, and you can also use **std::printf**, **std::cout**, or the GNU debugger GDB."
