This course is designed to impart just enough \"Survival C/C++\" in order to get things done in scientific computing, and to better understand the code that is covered in subsequent courses.

    "The current [IEEE754 standard](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229) for floating point numbers was established in 1985 and is the standard used in many applications, including OpenCL implementations. The bits that make up a floating point number are laid out in three sections: a **sign bit**, a **floating point exponent**, and a **mantissa**. The sign bit occupies one bit, the floating point exponent has **NBE** bits, and the mantissa has **NBM** bits. The total number of bits for a floating point number is then NBE+NBM+1. The **floating point exponent** **(E)** is just an unsigned integer with **NBE** bits. In order to represent negative powers of 2, the value of E is subtracted by a **Bias** equal to $2^{\\mathrm{NBE}-1}-1$ to form an exponent (in the mathematical sense) with base 2. The **mantissa** is constructed the same way, but the value for the mantissa is $2^{0}==1$ plus the dot product of the mantissa bits with a vector of decreasing powers of 2 ranging from $2^{-1}$ to $2^{-\\mathrm{NBM}}$. All three components combine together to form the value, as shown below."

The result of your calculation might be able to be represented **exactly** using a floating point number, or it **might not**. The difference between the exact result and the **nearest floating point number** that can represent your result is called **floating point error**.

By solving $|\\Delta f|=2^{(E-\\mathrm{Bias}-\\mathrm{NBM})}=1$ for E, we see that the largest absolute value for which we can guarantee representation by a floating point number is $$N_{\\mathrm{max}} = (2^{\\mathrm{NBM}+1}-1).$$ For the nearest power of two whose absolute value is larger than this, the spacing becomes $|\\Delta f|=2$ and larger.\n",

In **Big-endian** represenation the bytes representing the higher powers of two (big end, or most significant) are first, and bytes representing the lower powers of two (little end, or least significant) are last. A **little-endian** representation swaps the ordering of the bytes and moves the least significant bytes to the front. In either case it is important to know that within each byte the ordering of the 8 bits is **unchanged**.\n",

Endianness becomes an **issue** when reading or writing files to disk or sending data over a network. This is why a simple binary dump of values to disk is **not suitable** for sharing data. Instead, use a file format such as [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) where the \"endian\" format and other explanatory metadata is included with the file."

For example, in the arrays above a step of 1 along dimension 1 (left to right) requires a **stride of 2** elements in row-major ordering and **3** elements in column-major ordering. The stride for each dimension is encapsulated in the strides vector **S**. In this example `S = (8,2,1)` for row-major and `S = (1,3,12)` for column-major representations. For any (zero-based) coordinate vector **C** the position **P** in the underlying memory allocation is just the dot product between the coordinate vector **C** and the strides vector **S**.\n",
